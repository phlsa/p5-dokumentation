Explanation for this first sketch. You might use the code tag to have some lines of text formatted with a monospaced font.

<code>
for (float i=0; i<10; i++) {
  ellipse(i*30, 300, 10, 10);
}
</code>

Of course you can have more than one code block in a text and more than one paragraph in a code block.

<code>
pushMatrix();
rotate(radians(45));
rect(0, 0, 20, 100);
popMatrix();

pushMatrix();
rotate(radians(135));
rect(0, 0, 20, 100);
popMatrix();
</code>
